Menu
=====

We named it `0_menu.py` so it shows up on the top in the brick program::

             Crane
        >>>  Swing
             Calibrate
             ....

Displays a menu in which we muve with the UP DOWN keys up and down. We leave with the left
key and select a program with the right key.
